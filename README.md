MSSA Powershell Project 

Don I recommend adding some information here on what you hope to achieve with this project.  Something like an learning objective and a functional objective of the project.  I think that is an easy touch to make your profile more professional for use of your GitHub on your resume.  I would also recommend experimenting with this tool to collaborate with other so you get familiar with the process.  It shows activity on your profile that is viewable with a public profile.
